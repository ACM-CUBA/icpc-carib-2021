% To add an image or include a .tex file you need to add
% \CWD
% to the relative (to the main document) path.
%
% Example:
% \begin{center}
%   \includegraphics{\CWD/images/example.pdf}
% \end{center}
You are given the coordinates of $n$ points and a set of $m$ isosceles right triangles. The legs (shortest sides) of the triangles are parallel to the coordinate axes.\\

For each triangle, you have to find how many of the given points it contains.\\

%
% For input, use one of the following
%


\inputdesc{First line contains two positive integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \leq n,m \leq 10^5)$, the numbers of points and the number of triangles respectively.\\

    Next $n$ lines contain two integers $x$ $y$ $(-10^9\le x,y \le 10^9)$, the coordinates of each of the given points.\\

    Next $m$ lines contain six integers $x_1\ y_1\ x_2\ y_2\ x_3\ y_3$ $(-10^9\le x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,x_3,y_3 \le 10^9)$,
    the coordinates of the vertices of the given triangles.
}
%
% For output, use one of the following
%

\outputdesc{Print $m$ numbers in separated lines, the number of points on each triangle.}
%\sampleio will look for files named sample-n.in and sample-n.sol (where n is 1, 2, 3...)
%in the documents directory and include them as samples.
