Let $h$ be a function defined on the set of all positive integers such that $h(n)=(-1)^n \cdot n \cdot p + k$, $(1 \le p,k \le 10^{17})$.\\

Find the minimum positive integer $x$ such that $h(x) \ge m$, $(1 \le m \le 10^{17})$. It can be proven that such $x$ exists.\\



%
% For input, use one of the following
%

\inputdesc{The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \le t \le 10^5)$, representing the number of test cases.\\

    The following $t$ lines contain three spaced separated integers $p$, $k$, $m$, describing each test case.
}
%
% For output, use one of the following
%

\outputdesc{For each test case, print a line with one integer, the minimum positive integer $x$ such that $h(x) \ge m$.

%\sampleio will look for files named sample-n.in and sample-n.sol (where n is 1, 2, 3...)
%in the documents directory and include them as samples.
