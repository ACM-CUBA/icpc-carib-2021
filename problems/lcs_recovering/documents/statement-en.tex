The \textit{LCS} (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm of two binary strings $A$ and $B$ returns a matrix as follows:\\

\begin{minipage}{12cm}
    \begin{verbatim}
    LCS(A, B):
        n = len(A)
        m = len(B)
        M = Array[n, m] // the matrix is full of zeroes

        for i = 1 to n
            for j = 1 to m
                if A[i] == B[j]
                    M[i][j] = M[i-1][j-1] + 1
                else
                    M[i][j] = max(M[i-1][j], M[i][j-1])
        return M
  \end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}\\



Given a matrix $M$, find the smallest among all possible pairs of binary strings $A$ and $B$ such that \textit{LCS(A, B)} returns $M$. A pair $(A, B)$ is smaller than $(C, D)$ if $(A+B)$ is lexicographically smaller than $(C+D)$ where the operator $+$ denotes string concatenation.

% For input, use one of the following
%

\inputdesc{First line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^3)$, the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix.\\

    Next $n$ lines contain $m$ integers each. The $j$\textit{-th} element in the $i$\textit{-th} line is $M[i][j]$.\\

    It is guaranteed that there exists at least two binary strings such that the \textit{LCS} algorithm returns the given matrix.\\

    Please note that the given matrix differs from the one at the pseudocode by not having the row number 0 and column number 0 for simplicity.

% For output, use one of the following
%

\outputdesc{Print one binary string $A$ of length $n$ on the first line and one binary string $B$ of length $m$ on the second line, such that the pair $(A, B)$ is the smallest lexicographically where the \textit{LCS} algorithm returns the given matrix.}
