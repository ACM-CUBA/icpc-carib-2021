To solve this problem we need to obtain some information from the \textit{LCS}
matrix. The idea is to detect the pairs $(i, j)$ such that $A[i] = B[j]$ or
$A[i] \neq B[j]$.

But first, let's note the following property of any \textit{LCS} matrix:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Let $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ be two adjacent positions (by row, column
        or diagonal) on a \textit{LCS} matrix $M$, then  $|M[a][b] - M[c][d]|
        \le 1$.

\end{itemize}

The proof of this is simple, if $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ are on the same row or
column, then in the DP transition only one character was added, so the
\textit{LCS} could not increase; and similarly in the case where they are
adjacent diagonally, in the DP transition one character was added to each
string, so the \textit{LCS} could increase in at most one.

So, with this and noting that the \textit{LCS} increases (or stays the same) on
rows (from left to right) and columns (from top to bottom); there are only five
cases we need to analyse on a \textit{LCS} matrix:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            $x - 1$ & $x$ \\ \hline
            $x$ & $x$ \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}

    \item
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            $x - 1$ & $x - 1$ \\ \hline
            $x$ & $x$ \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}

    \item
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            $x - 1$ & $x$ \\ \hline
            $x - 1$ & $x$ \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}

    \item
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            $x$ & $x$ \\ \hline
            $x$ & $x$ \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}

    \item
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            $x - 1$ & $x - 1$ \\ \hline
            $x - 1$ & $x$ \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
\end{enumerate}

Where $x = M[i][j]$.

In the first, second and third case we don't get any information. In the fourth
case, we know that $A[i] \neq B[j]$ because if not $M[i][j]$ would be $x + 1$;
and in the fifth case we know that $A[i] = B[j]$.

Now with this information, we create a graph $G$ connecting, with undirected
edges, the node $i$ with the node $j + n$ if $A[i] = B[j]$ and compress that
graph. Then we add undirected edges in a new graph $G'$ (this graph has number of
connected components of $G$ nodes) from the component where node $i$ is to the
component where node $j + n$ is if $A[i] \neq B[j]$ (all indexes start from 1).

In this stage, the problem reduces to find a bipartition on this graph $G'$
(note that this graph is bipartite, because we always connected indexes of $A$
to indexes of $B$), but we need to do this processing each node from $1$ to $n
+ m$ coloring with $0$ first, to obtain the lexicographically smallest
solution.

The time complexity is $O(n \cdot m)$.
