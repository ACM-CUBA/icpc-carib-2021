We call a matrix of integers ``even'' if the sum of the numbers in each row is even and the sum of the numbers in each column is even.\\

In the following examples, matrices $A$, $B$ and $C$ are ``even''. Matrix $D$ is not ``even'' because the second column and the last row have odd sums.  Matrix $E$ is not ``even'' because its two columns have odd sums.\\

\begin{equation*}
  A =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    2
  \end{bmatrix},
  B =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 3 & 0 \\
    3 & 5 & 6
  \end{bmatrix},
  C =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    3 & 1 \\
    1 & 9
  \end{bmatrix},
  D =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 8 \\
    3 & 0 & 7 \\
    0 & 4 & 3
  \end{bmatrix},
  E =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    7 & 3
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}


Given a matrix $A$, convert it into an ``even matrix'' by performing \textbf{as few as possible} of the following type of operation:\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Select a cell of the matrix and increment its value by 1. You may select
        the same cell in different operations.
\end{itemize}

Print any final ``even'' matrix that results of executing the minimum number of operations.

%
% For input, use one of the following
%

\inputdesc{The first line contains two integers $r$ and $c$ $(1 \le r, c \le 50)$. Following $r$ lines define matrix $A$. Each line contains $c$ integers with values between $0$ and $100$. The $j$\textit{-th} number of the $i$\textit{-th} line is the cell $A_{i, j}$ of the matrix.}

%
% For output, use one of the following
%

\outputdesc{Print any ``even matrix'' that results from performing the minimum
  number of operations on matrix $A$. Then print $r$ rows, with $c$ numbers in each row, describing the matrix after applying the operations.}


%\sampleio will look for files named sample-n.in and sample-n.sol (where n is 1, 2, 3...)
%in the documents directory and include them as samples.
