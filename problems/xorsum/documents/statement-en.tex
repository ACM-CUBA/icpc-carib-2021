Given a list $A$ with $n$ positive integers. You are allowed to change at most two elements from the list into any two elements of your choice.\\

Your goal is to maximize the formula:\\

$$S = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i \oplus A_{i+1}$$

where the symbol $\oplus$ stands for the \textit{xor} operation (exclusive or).\\

%
% For input, use one of the following
%

\inputdesc{
    First line of input contains an integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 10^5)$, the size of the list. Second line contains the elements of $A$ separated by space such that $(0 \le A_i < 2^{30})$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$.
}

%
% For output, use one of the following
%

\outputdesc{
Print a single integer, the maximum value of $S$ you can get.\\

\textbf{Note:} The new values of $A$ must remain withing the range $[0, 2^{30})$.

%\sampleio will look for files named sample-n.in and sample-n.sol (where n is 1, 2, 3...)
%in the documents directory and include them as samples.
